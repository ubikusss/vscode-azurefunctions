# Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code (Preview)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions) [![Release Status](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions.svg?label=prerelease&colorB=0E7FC0)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions/releases)

Create, debug, manage, and deploy Azure Functions directly from VS Code. Check
out this [deployment tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/functions-extension/getting-started)
to get started with the Azure Functions extension.

## Prerequisites

Follow the OS-specific instructions to install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local):

* [Windows](#windows)
* [Mac](#mac) (Homebrew)
* [Linux](#linux) (Ubuntu/Debian)

Install the prerequisites for your desired language:

* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [C#](#c)
* [Java](#java)

> **NOTE**: You may change your `azureFunctions.projectLanguage` user setting to multiple other 'preview' languages not listed above. This allows you to create a project/function in that language, but we do not yet support local debugging for these languages.

## Features

* Create new Function projects
* Create new Functions from a template
* Debug Function projects locally
* Deploy to Azure Function Apps
* View, create, delete, start, stop, and restart Azure Function Apps
* View, edit, upload, and download application settings
* JSON Intellisense for `function.json`, `host.json`, and `proxies.json`
* Stream logs from your remote Function Apps
* Debug Java Function App on Azure (experimental)
    > **NOTE**: To enable it, you can set `azureFunctions.enableRemoteDebugging` to true.

## OS-Specific Prerequisites

> **NOTE**: npm can be used on all platforms. On unix platforms, you may need to specify `--unsafe-perm` if you are running npm with sudo. That's due to npm behavior of post install script.

### Windows

Both v1 and v2 of the runtime can be installed on Windows. v2 is cross platform, but is still in preview and not recommended for production use. v1 is Windows-only, but is approved for production use.

To install v1:

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools
```

To install v2:

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@core --unsafe-perm true
```

### Mac

```bash
brew tap azure/functions
brew install azure-functions-core-tools
```

### Linux

1. Register the Microsoft Product key as trusted.

    ```bash
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
    sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg
    ```

1. Set up package feed
    * Ubuntu 18.04

        ```bash
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-bionic-prod bionic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
        sudo apt-get update
        ```

    * Ubuntu 17.10

        ```bash
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-artful-prod artful main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
        sudo apt-get update
        ```

    * Ubuntu 17.04

        ```bash
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-zesty-prod zesty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
        sudo apt-get update
        ```

    * Ubuntu 16.04 / Linux Mint 18

        ```bash
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
        sudo apt-get update
        ```

1. Install

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install azure-functions-core-tools
    ```

## Language-Specific Prerequisites

### JavaScript

* [Node 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/)

### C#

* [VS Code Debugger for C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
* [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x)

> **NOTE**: The default experience for C# uses class libraries (&ast;.cs files), which provide superior performance, scalability, and versatility over C# Scripts (&ast;.csx files). If you want to use C# Scripts, you may change your `azureFunctions.projectLanguage` user setting to `C#Script`.

### Java

* [VS Code Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
* [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Maven 3.0+](https://maven.apache.org/)
  > **NOTE**: Once Maven is downloaded, you must ensure that Maven is in your PATH environment variable. You can check this by running: `mvn -v`.

## Managing Azure Subscriptions

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

![Sign in to Azure](resources/SignIn.gif)

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "Create a Free Azure Account..." or selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "filter" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions". Note that this selection affects all VS Code extensions that support the [Azure Account and Sign-In](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) extension.
